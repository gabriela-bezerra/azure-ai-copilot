# Generative AI and Azure OpenAI Labs 

This readme summarizes my experience and learnings from completing two hands-on labs: 
1. [Explore generative AI](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/mslearn-ai-fundamentals/Instructions/Labs/12-generative-ai.html)
2. [Use Azure OpenAI Service](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/mslearn-ai-fundamentals/Instructions/Labs/13-azure-openai.html)

## Process Overview

The first lab provided an introduction to generative AI using Azure Cognitive Services and the Bing Image Creator service. Key steps included:

- Signing up for a free Bing Image Creator account 
- Using text prompts to generate images in different styles
- Iterating on prompts to refine the generated images
- Reflecting on potential business use cases for generative AI

The second lab dove deeper into using the Azure OpenAI service to generate text. Main activities were:

- Deploying an Azure OpenAI resource
- Testing out the OpenAI Playground to generate text completions and chat responses
- Fine-tuning a custom model on a dataset of FAQs
- Deploying the model and testing it through the UI and REST API

## Key Insights 

Some of my main takeaways and insights from the labs:

- Generative AI has immense potential to augment human creativity and productivity. The Bing Image Creator and Azure OpenAI demos showcase how AI can quickly generate high quality images and text with simple prompts.

- Prompt engineering is critical to getting good results from generative models. The labs reinforced the importance of iterating on prompts, providing clear instructions, and giving the model good examples to work from.

- Azure OpenAI makes powerful language models like GPT accessible through a managed cloud service. This radically lowers the barrier to entry for developers looking to build AI-powered apps.

- Fine-tuning allows customizing foundation models for specific domains and use cases. The FAQ answering example illustrated how fine-tuning on a small dataset can yield an effective specialized model.

## Possibilities

Going through these labs gave me many ideas for how generative AI could be applied, such as:

- Automating content creation for marketing and social media
- Building AI-powered design tools and assistants 
- Creating interactive characters and storylines for games
- Developing intelligent tutoring and support chatbots
- Summarizing long documents and extracting key insights
- Generating code snippets and templates for software development

The accessibility of services like Azure OpenAI is a game-changer that opens up generative AI to a much wider range of developers and organizations. I'm excited to further explore this technology and its potential!
